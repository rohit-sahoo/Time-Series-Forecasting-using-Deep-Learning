# Time-Series-Forecasting-using-Deep-Learning
This repository has two projects on Time Series Forecasting using Deep Learning
As a result of the data science machine learning and deep learning evolution, time series prediction (forecasting) has seen tremendous increases in predicted accuracy. Businesses and financial institutions may now anticipate better by applying new technology to old issues as these ML/DL tools have matured. In this article, we demonstrate the usage of an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Deep Learning model, which is effective for issues requiring sequences with autocorrelation. I examined a well-known historical data collection known as "sunspots" (a sunspot is a solar phenomenon wherein a dark spot forms on the surface of the sun).

## Sunspots
Sunspots are black spots on the surface of the Sun. Because they are cooler than the rest of the Sun's surface, they appear dark. However, the temperature of a sunspot remains extremely high - approximately 6,500 degrees Fahrenheit!
Sunspots are used to monitor the solar cycle. The solar cycle is the cycle of the Sun's magnetic field that occurs every 11 years.
